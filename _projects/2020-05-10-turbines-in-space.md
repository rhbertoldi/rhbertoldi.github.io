Given the economics of energy demand, cost-effective renewables are going to be key in substituting oil demand. Land-based utility-scale wind is one of the lowest-priced energy sources today, costing between two and six cents per kilowatt-hour, and it happens to be clean and sustainable. Wind development, however is often met with pushback against communities not wishing to live near a turbine farm. Sound and visual impact of wind turbines are associated with nuisance factors that discourage individuals from willingly living near turbine farms. I am interested in the potential relationship between income and wind turbine locations. The goal of my research project is to analyze the effects of median income on the number of wind turbines on the state level in the greater United States, or on the county level within a particular state.

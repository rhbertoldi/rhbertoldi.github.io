According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2016, five Heartland states - Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma and North Dakota - sourced over 20% of their electricity generation from wind power. It was also stated in this year that wind energy supplied over 5.5% of electricity nationally. In the wake of climate change, renewable energy sources like wind power are vital. This inspired my project, where I scraped wind energy production, as well as electric generation from other fuel types, in California, from the California Energy Commission.

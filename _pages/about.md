I am a second year M.P.P. student at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. My research interests are motivated by the ways in which equity lenses can inform environmental policy solutions. I’m passionate about compassionate and inclusive solutions to climate problems. My research includes developing predictive models to help bridge the divide in global, environmental data access. Outside of class, I enjoy climbing, board games and playing water polo.

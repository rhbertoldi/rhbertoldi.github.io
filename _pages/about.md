I am a recent graduate of the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. My research interests are motivated by the ways in which equity lenses can inform environmental policy solutions. I am passionate about compassionate and inclusive solutions to climate problems. My research includes developing predictive models to help bridge the divide in global, environmental data access. Outside of class, I enjoy climbing, backpacking, board games and playing water polo.

I am a second-year M.P.P. student at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. My research interests are rooted in the intersection of human rights and the environment. My research includes studying how economic shocks shift human behavior and predicting PM2.5 concentrations to help bridge the divide in global environmental data access. I believe that sustainable environmental policy solutions are not only informed by science, but also by racial and environmental justice. I’m passionate about compassionate and inclusive solutions to climate problems. Outside of class, I enjoy climbing, board games and playing water polo.

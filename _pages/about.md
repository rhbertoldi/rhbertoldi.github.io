I am a recent graduate of the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. I am passionate and motivated by the ways robust data analysis, coupled with compassionate and proximate equity lenses can inform policy solutions. My research includes developing predictive models to help bridge the divide in global, environmental data access. Outside of class, I enjoy climbing, backpacking, board games and playing water polo.
